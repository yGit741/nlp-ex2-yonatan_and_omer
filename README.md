# Assignment 2

## Your Implementation
Please create a local copy of this template Colab's Notebook:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ChIJvhl7AGthnqjVl_wdroPmfjn1m8JF?usp=sharing)

The assignment's instructions are there; you can just follow the notebook.

## Testing
Copy the content of the `tests.py` file (as is) to the designated code cell in the notebook and run it.
It will produce and download the `results.json` file with the results of the tests.
Please replace the existing results file of this repo with your current one!

### Autograding for This Assignment

This assignment uses an autograding system that may seem a bit different. Keep the following points in mind:

1. **Total Score Matters:** Your final grade out of 100 is the primary indicator of your performance. This is the maximum achievable score for this assignment.

2. **Ignore Additional Metrics:** The autograder might display a higher threshold in its grading scale, leading to a total score of 150. This can result in checkmarks (‚úÖ) or Xs (‚ùå) next to specific tests, or even globally. These indicators do not accurately reflect your grade.

3. **Focus on Your Score:** Your final score out of 100 is the most accurate measure of how well you did. Remember, even if you see discrepancies in individual tests, they don't affect your final score, which is capped at 100.

## Submission
- **Notebook Link**: In the `notebook_link.txt` file, add the URL to your assignment's notebook, following the format provided in the example.
- **Access**: Ensure the link has edit permissions enabled to allow modifications if needed.
- **Deadline**: <font color='green'>12/06/2025, 23:59</font>.
- **Platform**: Continue using GitHub for submissions. 

## General instructions
- Please commit and push **only** the `results.json` and `notebook_link.txt` files. 
- Please avoid changing/deleting files under the .github folder, as this may interfere with the auto-grading operation.

GOOD LUCK! ü§ó
